# Material Shell
A **simple**, **productivity oriented** GNOME Shell replacement that provides an **innovative** and **automated** **mouse and keyboard [workflow](./documentation/material-shell.md#workflow)** which aims to be **faster** and **easier** to use and creates a **great user experience**.

Made by following the **[Material Design guidelines](https://material.io)** - a solid baseline that allows us to provide an **aesthetically pleasing** and **highly accessible** interface. 

The project is based on my earlier work on [Material Awesome](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-awesome).
