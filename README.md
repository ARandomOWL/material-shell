## Workflow

Our workflow is designed to **simplify** navigation and **reduce** the need to **manipulate** windows in order to **improve productivity**. It's meant to be 100% **predictible** and bring the benefits of tools covoted by professionnals to everyones. 

### Spatial Model

The spatial model is the core of the workflow and what everything is built around and in our case it's one of the simplest: **a Grid**

<p align="center" valign="middle">
Â <img align="center" valign="middle" src="./documentation/spatialisation.gif"
            alt="Spatialisation illustred">
</p>

Workspaces are applications containers and everything is **always sorted automatically**: The workspaces as rows and applications as cells.

Every **new application** is **automatically positioned** inside this grid at the end of its workspace's row and every **new workspaces** are **appended at the bottom** which is very **predictable**

This allow us to provide **intuitive navigation** by moving the screen around a larger context. Navigating **up** and **down** will change the current workspace and navigating **left** and **right** change the current window(s) on screen.

You can organize your applications by usescases as **activities** or by applications type as **categories**.

### Interface


### Design
Made by following the **[Material Design guidelines](https://material.io)** - a solid baseline that allows us to provide an **aesthetically pleasing** and **highly accessible** interface. 

### Persistence
The simplest way we found for user configuration is to keep every user decision permanent, that's way the user configure his layouts on the go while using it.

(We appreciate package maintainers! If you would like to make a package available for your distro please submit a PR so it can be added here!)

2. Reload GNOME Shell:
  + On X.org: Hit `Alt+F2` and type the command `r`
  + On Wayland: Log out and back in
3. Open `gnome-tweaks` and activate the `Material Shell` extension **OR** enable it using 
```bash
gnome-extensions enable material-shell@papyelgringo
```

## Workflow Hotkeys
Some hotkeys might already be used by GNOME Shell - please check your keybindings first.
#### Desktop navigation
* `Super+W` Navigate to the upper workspace/category.
* `Super+S` Navigate to the lower workspace/category.
* `Super+A` Focus the window at the left of the current window.
* `Super+D` Focus the window at the right of the current window.
* `Super+1`, `Super+2` ... `Super+0` Navigate to specific workspace

#### Window manipulation
* `Super+Q` Kill the current window focused.
* `Super+[MouseDrag]` Move window around.
* `Super+Shift+A` Move the current window to the left.
* `Super+Shift+D` Move the current window to the right.
* `Super+Shift+W` Move the current window to the upper workspace.
* `Super+Shift+S` Move the current window to the lower workspace.

#### Extra Hotkeys
* `Super+Space` Cycle the tiling layout of the current workspace.
* `Super+Escape` Toggle the UI of Material-shell, like a Zen mode.

## Uninstallation ðŸ˜¢
We're sad to see you go. Before you uninstall, leave us some feedback by [opening an issue](https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell/issues/new/choose) - it will be very helpful in improving Material Shell.

1. Open `gnome-tweaks` and disable the `Material Shell` extension **OR** disable it using 
```bash
gnome-extensions disable material-shell@papyelgringo
```
2. Delete the extension directory.
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/material-shell@papyelgringo
```
## History
The project is based on my earlier work on [Material Awesome](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-awesome).
